      <p>
        <strong>Manifest reduces your company's retirement plan costs by 20% by increasing your employee retirement savings.</strong></p>

<p>By putting participants first, our team has developed a suite of tools that can be accessed in a responsive web app. Historically, hunting down old accounts, selecting a destination, and running checks would take 60+ days. It's no wonder 89% of people who start a transfer don't finish.</p>

<p>Manifest brings the process down to less than 10 minutes. Better yet, we just launched a few new features to make participant communication easier.</p>

<p>Manifest is a magic layer that sits on top of any 401(k) plan. Supercharging your plan also results in 5x administrative savings for your teammates.</p>

<p>Let's break all of this down for <span id="companyname">[CompanyName]</span> plan.
